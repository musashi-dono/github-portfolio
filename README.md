## Statement
    Hi! My name is Dhonred Abarca but most people call me Red. I am currently a 4th year BS Psychology student and working towards my degree but that doesnâ€™t stop me from learning different things like Cybersecurity and IT Support. I communicate well with others and that allows me to get along with other people especially when working on a project. I like helping people and as a tech support and a cybersecurity analyst I can do just that by helping users protect their privacy, mitigating threats, and assisting clients with troubleshoots.
